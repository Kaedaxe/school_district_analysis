# School District Analysis
## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to import and manipulate the raw CSV files schools_complete.csv and students_complete.csv in the Jupyter Notebook framework. By doing so, we can remove errors in the data and generate useful logistics from the various schools in the district. The tools primarily used to accomplish these tasks come from the Pandas dataframe structure, allowing functions that can interact with the imported dataframe. 

## Results 

### How is the district summary affected?
The change isn't that significant, but the passing percent in reading, math, and overall have all dropped slightly. A before and after is listed below.
